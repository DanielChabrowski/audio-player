### About
This project started as a quick check of how hard it would be to play music with QMediaPlayer. After forming a very simple GUI I had an idea to try and recreate the look of my favourite audio player [foobar2000](https://www.foobar2000.org/) which unfortunately is not available for linux that I am now using natively. As a result, there's a ton of features not implemented simply because I wasn't using them (like some menu items being empty) but it is enough for me to use it daily.
